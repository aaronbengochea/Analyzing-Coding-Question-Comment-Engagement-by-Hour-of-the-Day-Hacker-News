## Comment Engagement Analysis: Hacker News Forums
Performed an analysis to determine which times of the day yield the highest comment engagement. The samples consisted of questions posted on the Hacker News Forums: "Ask HN" thread. The "Ask HN" thread acts as Hacker News go-to programming forum where users go to ask questions where other users then chime in with their answers/solutions/suggestions/discussions on the topic.
