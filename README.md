# Analyzing-Coding-Question-Comment-Engagement-by-Hour-of-the-Day-Hacker-News
Performed an analysis to determine which times of the day yield the highest comment engagement centered around a question asked on the Hacker News Forums: Ask HN thread. The Ask HN thread acts as Hacker News go-to programming forum where users go to ask questions where other users then chime in with their answers/solutions/suggestions/discussions on the topic.
